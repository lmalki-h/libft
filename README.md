## What's Libft?

Libft is the first project of 42. It consists in building _your own library of C functions_. In this project you start from scratch, with the only help of libc functions write, malloc and free.


In this project you:
* reproduce the behavior of functions that are part of the **C standard library** (as defined in their man)
* code some additional functions that are deemed useful for later projects 
* code some functions for **linked list manipulation**


You can read the project instructions [here](libft.en.pdf)


> **Disclaimer:** Reinventing the wheel is bad. 42 makes us do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms.
> At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, 
> so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.



## How do I use this library?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmalki-h/libft libft/
cd libft/
make
```


## Project status:
My code is not the best but it was submitted as is. I will be adding functions to my library as I go farther in my school program.
